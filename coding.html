        <h1>My coding</h1>
        <p> I don't have a complex project to share but i have my course work from 2nd semester.
            The task was to create a library inventory system and so i did it. <br> You can download
            the program if you want at this <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V6c6vkNUDcj2cta98oUxntFh0Q9OSKKi/view?usp=sharing>link</a>
        </p>
        <img src="img/coursework.png" alt="main window of the program" height="80%" width="90%">
        <p> As you can see, this program is capable to read information from the database and update it
            depending on the users input. Searching, editing of the book by its parameters, adding your own book and deleting
            are the functions that are realised.<br>You can also navigate at this main window
            to see all content of the library but you can't read the books.
