                <h2>Rolling Stones</h2>
            <p>Rolling Stones is a temporary name for my first unfinished game
                that i was developing using Unity engine. I had a little knowledge on C#
                prior to the development and always struggled with scripting because i didn't
                know  how to do it. After watching official Unity tutorial on this topic i got
                a huge inspiration and took the main concept of a tutorial as my 
                main game mechanics<br>
                I had huge plans for this game and made all of the models and textures 
                myself as i played with 3D modeling software prior to this except for
                grass and dirt textures made by my girlfriend.
                This game was considered hard by most of the players that tested it and
                i can't disagree with it because i made it hard intentially. 
                Lost inspiration and stopped the development, but recently tried to continue
                it and understood that it is better to start with a new game
                because the code is a mess.

            <h2>Rocket thruster </h2>
            <section class="right">
                <p>Rocket thruster is another project which i have been developing
                    during June of 2020 and haven't finished yet. I wanted to create a simple game 
                    for mobile devices as it would require less time to develop and also it would
                    easier to publish it and get playerbase. As the development was going on, 
                    i began to question myself whether this game is entertaining or not.
                    I couldn't really decide what to change with the art style and gameplay
                    and lost my inspiration once again. But this project is considered as my
                    recent one and probably i will return to it somewhen. This game
                    has three gamemodes planned: standart gamemode with specific amount of levels,
                    flappy rocket mode in which you need to avoid generated obstacles in front of
                    the rocket and the challenge mode in which you will have limited amount of fuel
                    and the levels will be much difficult than in standart mode. Currently, there are
                    two standart mode levels and flappy rocket mode which can be played.</p>
